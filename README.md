# Guadalajara_Tour_Guide_TSP
Guadalajara Tour Guide project that calculates the shortest route to visit the chosen tourist places in GDL. Based of Travelling Salesman Problem.

Foreign exchange students at TEC GDL want to visit different tourist spots in Guadalajara.
It is desired to find the shortest route that visits the tourist points selected by the student
starting from the tec, without repeating points and with the option of returning to the point of origin (TEC GDL) or not.

There are four scenes in the Unity project. You should run the "Menu" scene, as the program starts from there.

1- First select the places that you want to visit
2- Check if you want to get back to the starting point (TEC Campus Guadalajara)
3- See the displayed animation showing the shortest route that visits the specifed locations.


Note: ths only considers distance, not traffic or other important parameters for a more accurate calculation.
